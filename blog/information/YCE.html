        <h2>The Spark of Creation</h2>
        <p>
            Inspiration often begins quietly. A single thought, a fleeting memory, or an
            unexpected encounter can grow into an idea powerful enough to shape entire
            projects. In the journey of creating, every spark matters, and every step
            tells a story.
        </p>
        <p>
            Flames Risen was born from these sparks â€” small but steady bursts of creativity
            that come together to build something greater. Through reflections, writing,
            and storytelling, this space explores the beauty of crafting meaning from
            imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like fire, ideas rise when given breath. They shift, spread, and transform,
            not always predictable, but always carrying warmth and light. This blog is
            a collection of those flames â€” stories that inspire, thoughts that linger,
            and moments worth remembering.
