        <h1>YCE</h1>
        <p>YCE, 3 persons, one action. Shaped Ray's Idea, The Story of Neutra Lore, and the vision.</p>
        <p>How and why, and why is it controversial?</p>

    </header>

    <main>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The ‘YCE’ is what shaped the ideas and the development of The Luminous Project, alternatively known as
            "Neutra Lore."
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘YCE’, however, isn't a simple concept or idea of what we think of. Before ‘YCE’, it started with ‘Y’; its
            roots began all the way from the earliest development days of Neutra Lore,
            before the V3R Development Team was formed. Then, another two changed, and the vision.
        </p>
        <p>
            An idea of "three person, three uniqueness", after I realized, and became a source, contributed (directly or
            indirectly), driven to create new ideas, inspirations, and development.
            Yet, inspiration often comes with controversial topics, specifically a common topic called "shipping". What
            began as inspiration, admiration, and influence turned into misunderstandings,
            questions, debates about its meanings, and intentions.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this blog post, we will be uncovering the history and intentions behind “Y,” “C,” and “E,” why they are
            important, what my opinion is on them, and how their influence continues throughout the developing journey.
        </p>
        <h2>How and Why</h2>
        <p>
            One of them has their own characters on Neutra Lore: "Sha Gajiko", "Jun Cess Anseonjin", and "Eliza
            Igancia". Not their names, but taken from the Neutra Lore Characters, which are connected to them. The
            reason why I chose or admire them is because of one action that caused a change in Ray's Idea and
            Development. Not something we all think of, but rather inspiration and compassion.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Y’, the FIRST person who shaped Ray's Idea of making Neutra Lore with one character. ‘C’, the SECOND person
            who admired the projects, which was named NSD:TC to NSD Anseonjin Training Center (ATC), and leading up to
            the creation of Project: Liwanag, which is formerly known as DNA-PC, an ongoing project of the core game.
            ‘E’, the THIRD person, in a swift replacement, I decided to make ‘E’ the 3rd because of potential problems
            that may arise about ‘C’. Also a friend, but on the other side. One message I stumbled upon back then, when
            no one said 'hi.' Then "E" replied, "hello." Somehow, out of nowhere, this led to the creation of the
            Quality of Life (QoL) Project, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the development days of The Luminous Project, Neutra Lore (Take 1). The part where I need to come up
            with a new character, such as Ray, Ethan, and so on, that idea struck me when I was playing. A joke
            character that I made back then turned into a character for Neutra Lore. Though I felt that it’s not right
            to take its name, every time I make a character or come up with names, I do. So I decided to make changes to
            avoid directly mentioning or involving its name outright. Since the characters had no feelings or
            personality (unless given) at all, it is based on personality or behavior. It still doesn’t feel right, but
            it passed through checks, ensuring it is not directly.

        </p>
        <p>
            As stated in the blog post rules, be mindful of personal information and secrets between each other!
            I respect their privacy, and you should respect yours too. Since they weren’t aware of The Luminous Project,
            I made it because of an idea, instead of being bored sometimes, and burnout from the tasks. A story that is
            really based on Ray JL’s life and then to the world's problems, but in a different dimension or universe.
        </p>
        <p>
            A kind of something that writers wanted in their lives, but didn’t achieve when they were young.
        </p>
        <p>A mix of genres in one project or a story. Maybe preferably, mostly all. Take 1 was really hard, actually,
            since you had to correct them all. Take 2 was fine, but a bit of a problem. Take 3 is what we’re going to
            solve with Take 1 and Take 2 of the Neutra Lore problem, and make it clear to an audience without knowing
            it. Learning from mistakes, determining the audience, the community, and so on.
        </p>
        <h2>Why is it controversial or issue?</h2>
        <p>
            We’re here with names that have issues, and that’s a risk I’ve thought about. The danger of silence, though,
            was greater. Rumors grew because I didn’t explain, and without clarity, people filled the gaps with their
            own assumptions.

        </p>
        <p>
            My goal isn’t to spread those misunderstandings but to face them directly and then shift the focus to what
            “YCE” truly stands for—inspiration, not rumor. I don’t want the blog to revolve around negativity; most of
            it documents their positive impact on projects, with only a section dedicated to clearing up misconceptions
            for closure.
        </p>
        <p>
            That’s why I avoid using their real names and instead transform their presence into characters, traits, or
            contributions. I’m not trying to “own” their actions or put them under a spotlight—it’s about recognizing
            the moments of inspiration that redirected my path. If any of them ever felt uncomfortable, I would respect
            that fully, because the purpose has never been to expose but to honor.
        </p>
        <p>Consent matters, which is why I frame “YCE” less as individual identities and more as the roles they played
            in shaping creativity. What they sparked in me lives on in the projects, not as a spotlight on them
            personally.
        </p>
        <p>There are also tangible milestones tied to their influence. “C” inspired the naming shift from NSD:TC to
            Anseonjin Training Center, also directly shaped Project: Liwanag’s direction. “Y” sparked the very first
            character concepts that evolved into Neutra Lore. “E”, through something as simple as replying “hello,” set
            off a chain that gave birth to the Quality of Life project. These aren’t imagined connections—they are
            traceable points in the timeline of my work. </p>
        <p>At the same time, I acknowledge that inspiration is partly subjective. Legacy, however, isn’t built on
            objectivity or personal meaning alone; it’s the intersection of both. For me, “YCE” is that meeting point.
            The hardest part is knowing I can’t control how others interpret what I write, and I accept that
            misunderstandings may still arise. But this defense is the moment I draw a line between inspiration and
            rumor. My role is to set the record straight now so that the foundation isn’t misunderstood, and then let
            the projects stand on their own strength.</p>
        <p>Neutra Lore, the games, the stories—these will carry the legacy forward without the need for constant
            explanations. Inspiration should outlast controversy, and that is what I want “YCE” to be remembered for.
        </p>
        <p>If future readers find this blog post, and you know the meaning, the history, and so on.
            I want them to see that the record was set straight early on—that inspiration, not rumor, was the truth from
            the start. The safeguard is in the way I continue building. Neutra Lore, Project: Liwanag, and the rest of
            V3R’s work will be documented and shared on their own terms, with this defense being only one piece in a
            much larger body of history. Future readers won’t just see “YCE” tied to rumors—they’ll see “YCE” tied to
            creative milestones. The blog is structured so the focus remains on creativity, with the clarification as
            context, not centerpiece. In the long run, the projects themselves will overshadow the controversy, because
            they are the real evidence of what “YCE” stood for. This post is a bridge, not the destination—it closes one
            chapter so the work can speak louder than speculation. I see “YCE” not as a permanent label tied to
            individuals, but as a role they played in shaping creativity. It's important to make that balance explicit.
            The facts are there—naming changes, project directions, even the timing of small exchanges that sparked big
            outcomes. But what makes them meaningful is how I interpreted them.
        </p>
        <p>First, started with one work shared for ‘E’, to show the new project’s name, yet it created the rumor
            involving an unexpected return, which is the misunderstandings and confusion between Ray and ‘E’. Before the
            rumor started, on January 20, 2025. I said to my friend, Ethan. If he can direct-message ‘E’ about a new
            subproject, in which he accepted it. And I also agreed to tell that it was from me. On January 23, 2025,
            during a normal conversation with my friend, Ethan.
            We started explaining some topics related to personal and such, and I have been informed that the other
            section in my class, with the new project codenamed "Ignacio", I sent for ‘E’ to view. The story was about
            debating and turned into a court session (although it's not) as Ethan explained, and made it clear. Then on
            February 9, 2025. I handed ‘E’ the V3R Development Team's Pilot Testing / GEN 1 Lanyard, along with the
            letter. “Adding another layer for defense.”</p>
        <p>The second and preferred ‘last’, ‘Y’. Recently, the ‘YCE’ became an issue again, which forced me to create
            this defense/blog post to make things clear and make things right. This situation is similar to ‘E’ rumors,
            but it's different. It's about right and wrong, and explanation, in which this time it's about her. It’s the
            battle for the RIGHT, and spotting the WRONG.
        </p>
        <p>These problems became controversial for two persons, except "Jun", who appreciated it.
            As she understands and acknowledges the project ongoing by the V3R Development Team.
            The reason why it became controversial for me is because of misunderstanding and misinformation about
            relationships, alternatively known as a ‘crush’.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>It is about recognizing them, whose presence, whether through an action, a message, or appreciation, changed
            the course of Neutra Lore and the vision. The meaning of “YCE” is not just 3 persons, but the personalities
            or traits that became sources of inspiration, not about assumptions of relationships. Their influence
